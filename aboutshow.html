<h1>About the Parallelocast</h1>
<p>
The Parallelocast was founded in 2018 CE in Denver, Colorado, presumably on a day that ends in "y". One man, Nate Earl, united a ragtag group of people to write a comedy podcast.
With their powers combined, they created the Parallelocast. It was rad. I mean, maybe not as cool as summoning an environmentalist superhero with their powers combined, but still 
really cool.<br/ >
<i><small>(Side note: is there a universe out there where the Parallelocasters are the Planeteers???)</small></i>
</p>

<p> 
Each episode of the Parallelocast is set in a different parallel universe. In episode 1, our noble Parallelocasters brought you a post-apocalyptic hellscape. There were a lot
of cannibals there. All writers were very much on the same page about the definite existence of cannibals in a post-apocalyptic hellscape.<br />In episode 2, those same 
Parallelo-hooligans delivered an episode about wrestling. What they lacked in basic knowledge about wrestling, they made up for with ridiculous wrestler names. I mean, if
"Wolverine but with Forks Instead" is not the best wrestler name you have ever heard then...why are you here? Go on, get.
</p>

<p>
Although the universes may be different from episode to episode, some things stay the same. Listeners can expect some commercials advetizing products for that episode's 
universe. In this universe we live in, we may not need to get food to our bunkers. We may not need to get our championship wrestling belts securely displayed. We may not even 
need one of the TBD products and/or services that may be advertised in episode 3! But we do need things that are equally ridiculous, so the writers have plenty of inspiration.
No universe is perfect!<br />
Listeners can also expect a soap opera scene. No matter which universe you're in, people <i>looooove</i> watching other people deal with hella secrets. Forbidden love, hidden identities, surprising revelations, oh my! Interestingly, every universes' soap operas seem to mysteriously use the same theme music. Curious indeed. Hmmmmm.
</p>

<p>
So that's the gist of it. You dig?
